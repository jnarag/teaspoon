### Get help

Please first read the [FAQs](FAQ.md) and [manual](manual.md) carefully. If you are still having trouble running TEASPOON, please:

- Check your machine has *at least* 2GB RAM
- Check your OS is running at least Java v1.7 (ideally v1.8+)
- Check you have downloaded [the latest version](installation.md)
- See if you can run the example files.

If all of the above seem fine, but your own data still doesn't run:

- Is your data formatted as .FASTA?
- Are all your sequences aligned and of identical length in the outgroup alignment and all timepoints' alignments?
- What output files are being produced? 
- How big is your dataset? TEASPOON should handle a few thousand sequences of a couple of thousand nucleotides in a few minutes on most laptops/desktops, but bigger datasets may take longer, or run out of RAM.
